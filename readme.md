## My user configuration for terminal based software development.

My workflow revolves around the terminal. It's fast, infinately customizable and easy to set up.

### Zsh

I am currently using [zsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) instead of bash.

### Vim

My editor of choice is vim, running inside a terminal so I can leverage as much of its power as possbile.

I have a fairly customized setup which is [documented here](https://github.com/compactcode/dot-files/tree/master/files/.vim).

### Misc

* [ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack) - A fast way to search through source code.
* [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) - A quick way to navigate around directories.

### Installation

```
git clone git://github.com/compactcode/dot-files.git

./dot-files/install.sh
```
