# My user configuration for terminal based software development.

My workflow revolves around the terminal. It's fast, infinately customizable
and easy to set up.

## Shell

I am currently using zsh instead of bash. It has a couple of small advantages
but my main reason for using it is the excellent community framework
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

## Editor

My editor of choice is vim, running inside my terminal so I can leverage as
much of its power as possbile.

I have a fairly customized setup which is documented here:
[vim](/tree/master/files/.vim/)

## Misc

[ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack) - Search
[autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) - Directory navigation

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:compactcode/dot-files.git

./dot-files/install.sh
./dot-files/install-osx-lion.sh
```
